# Changelog

## 0.1.0 (not released yet)

- Apps, Search, Downloads, Coming up, System and Settings, each on its own page.
- Search Sonarr, Radarr, Lidarr and Readarr at once and add what you find.
- Five designs: Health first (the default), Tiles, Shelf, Command and Status board, plus the Display and
  accessibility panel.
- Installer (Docker or systemd) and updater with backup and automatic roll-back.
- Password sign-in with a one-time setup code; API keys never reach the browser.
- Open it from phones and other computers on your home network, or switch that off in Settings so only the
  computer it runs on can connect. Docker uses host networking for this.
- Phone layout on every page; add it to your home screen.
- Each app's home address and outside address on its card, each with a copy button. Both are on by default;
  turn them off in Settings, General. Apps saved as 127.0.0.1 open on the address your browser used, so they
  work from a phone.
- Downloads show the download client's own state, so a paused client shows Paused.
